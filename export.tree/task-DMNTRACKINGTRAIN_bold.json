During this scan let your mind wander freely. Do not perform any sort of mental calculation, memory recall, or other mental tasks. IfÂ you notice yourself focusing on a particular stream of thoughts, let your mind wander away. Please stay awake and remain as still as possible. This scan will last 6 minutes."
