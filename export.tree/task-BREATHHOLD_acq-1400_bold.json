    "TaskName": "BREATH_HOLD_1400",
    "TaskDescription": "A breath hold task consisting 11 blocks repeated 7 times.  The first block is 10 seconds of rest, followed by 2 seconds of instructions, then 2 seconds of breathing in, 2 seconds of breathing out, 2 seconds for a deep breath and hold, and then 6 blocks with circles of increasing size indicating how long breath is to be held.",
    "Instructions": "Next will be the breath holding task. You’re going to see some prompts appear on the screen.  Follow those prompts just like in the practice.  Remember that when you see the 'Rest' on the screen, it means you can breathe normally.  Also remember, if you can’t hold your breath for the entire time the circles are on the screen, that’s okay. Just try your best and  keep as still as possible when you’re taking those deep breaths. This scan will be about 4 minutes.",
